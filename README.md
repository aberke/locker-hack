# locker-hack
This simple system helps Amazon customers improve their privacy while providing for others in need. It leverages the Amazon Locker infrastructure  and allows users to anonymously request  items they need to be securely sent to a locker.  Other users can ‘purchase privacy’ by anonymously fulfilling these requests while adding noise to their Amazon purchase profile.
